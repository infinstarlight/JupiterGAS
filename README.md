# Jupiter Plugin for Unreal

Hi there! This plugin is meant to help with development for Unreal Engine projects that utilize the Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

Oftentimes, when prototyping projects, I use GAS to handle damage logic. But unfortunately I recreate often the same or similar abilities between each project. So in an effort to reuse and recycle this logic (as well as learn how plugin development works) I created this project!

Contributions are welcomed and appreciated.
